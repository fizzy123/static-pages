I saw your face on a Sunday. It was warm, bright, and inviting. Your eyes were brown like your skin. 
<br>
<br>
And on Friday your eyes were green like the grass that sat under your legs
<br>
<br>
But on Monday they were purple? Like the pictures of galaxies. Swirling in colors that shouldn’t be noticeable by the human eye.

But on Monday they were purple? Like the pictures of galaxies. Swirling in colors that shouldn’t be noticeable by the human eye.
Finally on Wednesday they were black. The beginning and end melted into each other. Pools of depth lost creating one whole
<br>
<br>
I found a picture…… You weren’t the same, your face was distorted, like a video skipping over the most important part. But I remember your smell, sweet like jasmine, your presence warm like the candles in your room.
<br>
<br>
I tried to find you, to search for that missing feeling but I only remember your presence. It was once there now it’s gone.

Brown, Green, Purple, Black…..which one was it again?
<br>
<br>
I forgot your eyes, your smile, your laugh, your presence and your skin. I close my eyes day after day trying to remember what I lost. Where did it go?  How can I reach it again?
<br>
<br>
Why did I…..?
<br>
<br>
Ah…..I forgot I lost you in May. The flowers were in bloom. The petals open to the sunlight. The breeze carries their scent throughout the air. 
<br>
<br>
It started to rain and you grabbed my hand with a smile and ran. Your laugh was loud like a bell and finally your eyes were like honey warms pools that were stuck on me.
<br>
<br>
A sticky residue that takes effort to leave. A taste so strong that memories of it should never leave.
<br>
<br>
The picture was finally clear, a beautiful face forever locked in place. Memories that are filled with holes but not forever forgotten.
<br>
<br>
Brown, Green, Purple, Black, and Honey….all parts remembered and sometimes forgotten.
