    <div class="body">Hello team!

First off, I want to say how much I appreciate you and all the work you do, every single day. YouTopia is a dream and I’m honored that we’ve all come together to make this dream come true. Go Giltch! 

Second, in the interest of transparency, I want to give everyone an update on the status of our funding. As you all know, a couple of key investors pulled out last month due to reasons they stated as “the uncertain profitability of postmortem uploads”. In spite of this, I strongly believe that our postmortem feature will be a prominent selling point and I have the utmost faith in the team building our eternal storage capabilities to make this possible. I am working day and night to find new investors.

In the meantime, we currently have enough funding to continue work on this feature for another five months, and I am confident that the majority of it will be built and tested by then. I strongly encourage everyone to give it your all and inject as much passion into your work as I know we’re all capable of. If anyone needs to stay after hours to meet a deadline, I’ll most likely also be working and we can keep each other company (and maybe share a beer or two!).

Again, I know you’ve all been working hard and I am so grateful to each and every one of you. Please feel free to telephone me or walk into my office at any hour of the day for any questions.

Regards,
Jeff</div>
