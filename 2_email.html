      <div class="body">I regret to inform you of a major testing delay for the postmortem feature/coma patient enhancement. <br><br>The reasons for this delay are quite serious and certainly canâ€™t be overlooked. As such, the feature will have to remain in its testing phase for an indeterminate amount of time until we fix the issues.<br><br>In regards to our earlier discussion, I wholeheartedly concur that any potential instance of internal sabotage would be shameful to the highest degree, no matter the rumored ethical misgivings of some employees at this company. I personally believe these misgivings to be injudicious and unfounded.<br><br>You and I are both aware of the high priority placed on this feature. My team is working as hard as possible on this delay. Thank you for your patience.<br><br>Sincerely,<br>Sara Lee</div>
